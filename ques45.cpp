/*Explain the concept of priority queues and their applications in algorithm design. 

Ans:- A Priority Queue is a special type of queue where each element is associated with a priority, and elements are served based on their priority, not just their insertion order.
High-priority elements are served before low-priority ones.
If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their insertion order (depending on implementation).

Applications of Priority Queues:

Application	                            How it helps
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm	                Find shortest paths quickly by picking the closest node first.
Huffman Coding	                        Build optimal prefix codes in compression algorithms.
Job Scheduling	                        Serve most urgent or important tasks first.
Load Balancing	                        Handle higher priority requests first in server systems.
K Largest or K Smallest Elements	    Find the top/bottom K elements efficiently.
A Search Algorithm*	                    Pick nodes with the least estimated total cost first.
Data Stream Processing	                Maintain the running K-largest elements as new data arrives.*/
